This jupyter notebook compares different machine learning models to predict heart stroke and gives insights on the observations made after training different models on the heart stroke data. The dataset used was from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset This was cleaned and preprocessed using R. The R script can be found under "Dataset-Preprocessing". The cleaned dataset can be found as the "data_stroke_undersampled" CSV file.
